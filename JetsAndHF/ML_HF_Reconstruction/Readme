Instructions to Run the code:
1. Install hipe4ml
pip install hipe4ml (Ubuntu) or brew install libomp (Mac)
2. This requires signal and background features
Run D0 reconstrcution for D0 Sample and DIS Sample
Put the output root files in the directories: D0_Sample and DIS_Sample 
3. Go to the directory: ML_model_ePIC (I added the root files from ep 10x100, Q^2>1 GeV^2, Campaign: 25.04.1 as an example)
